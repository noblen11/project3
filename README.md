We plan to write 4 fuctions to seperate each task. every fuction will have for loops to loop through the timestamps 
and find the conditions in the prompt. The first 3 fuctions, suspicicious activites, system glitch, and irreseponsible behavior will use 
if then statements to see if the condions match. If they do its reported as a positive case. For each positive case the increment variable will increase by 1. For the last fuction, domain count, a dictionary will be made with the list of domains, we will use for loops to count the amount of times each domain occuured.  



Edit: we took a diferent aproach and wrote 2 fuctions instead. One called readlog() to read the userlog file and organize users with all of their respictive login and log out times in a nested dictionary, and another one to write out the generated report from the 4 questions into a file. We wrote the 4 questions in 4 different cells to prevent the code from getting cluttered. we used the log_dict dictionary created in the readlog() in every question cell to refer to that created dictionary and created multiple for loops to find  and if/else statements  to find what that particular question is looking for.
