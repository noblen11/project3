We plan to write 4 fuctions to seperate each task. every fuction will have for loops to loop through the timestamps 
and find the conditions in the prompt. The first 3 fuctions, suspicicious activites, system glitch, and irreseponsible behavior will use 
if then statements to see if the condions match. If they do its reported as a positive case. For each positive case the increment variable will increase by 1. For the last fuction, domain count, a dictionary will be made with the list of domains, we will use for loops to count the amount of times each domain occuured.
