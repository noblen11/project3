For project 3 we plan to posiblty write 4 fuctions to seperate each task. every fuction will have for loops to loop through the timestamps 
and find the conditions in the prompt. The first 3 fuctions, suspicicious activites, system glitch, and irreseponsible behavior will use 
if then statements to see if the condions match. If they do then the increment variable will increase by 1.  For the last fuction, domain count
it will run through the list of logins and return the amount of users that have the same domain as there are 4 different domains.
